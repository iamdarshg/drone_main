# drone_main
So this is attempt 2 at making a clean worksapce for the code, as of current this is mostly low-level, library like scripts to help work the hardware.

# TODO
1. Control FLow (diagram at minimum by 7/5/25)
2. communication package creator and handler 
3. figuring out how to write to the lpc43330
4. finding how debug patterns would work via jtag 
5. OS or custom handler creation choices
6. optimisation (as usual)
7. git worklfows (maybe?)
8. Motor control packages, PWM and similar
9. Better GPIO usage, hardware testing, hardware fab

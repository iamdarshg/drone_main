# Base Station Example Scripts

This directory will contain example scripts for automating base station tasks, integration with the UI, and real-world usage scenarios.

- `rf_receive_example.py`: Receive and print RF data from the drone
- `send_command_example.py`: Send a command to the drone from the PC
- `waypoint_upload_example.py`: Upload a waypoint mission to the drone

(Implementations to follow as the UI and firmware are completed.)

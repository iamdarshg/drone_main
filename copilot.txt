DONE: Implement actual SPI hardware access and error handling. QSPI routines for LPC4330 implemented in spi_bus.c, all stubs removed, robust error handling and rollback in place.
Action needed: Review all register addresses, scale factors, and ensure all hardware access is real from the provided datasheets.
DONE: Replace with real flash memory access routines. flash.c now uses QSPI routines for real hardware access, no RAM simulation remains.
DONE: UART subsystem (ext_uart.c/h) implemented for LPC4330, hardware-ready, configurable, no stubs. All modules now use real UART routines.
Implement The Kalman filter math.
Action needed: Ensure all gains are set by user/config.
Action needed: Replace all demo values and logic with real telemetry, configuration, or user input for production. Make map scaling and base location configurable.
Action needed: Ensure all configuration is settable and hardware access is real.
Action needed: Implement real flash memory access.
DONE: All major buffer sizes, module counts, and UART settings are now configurable via build system or config.h. No hardcoded values remain in production code.
Ensure all gains are set by user/config.
Action needed: Ensure all communication is real and configurable; remove any demo/test logic from production.
Action needed: Make thresholds configurable if needed.
DONE: Runtime PID/Kalman tuning CLI (cli_pid_kalman_tune) implemented. User can update gains live via UART/CLI, config is saved to flash. No stubs remain.

1. strong pid loops that take into account as many variables as possible
2. monitoring of spi and i2c bus usage
3. monitoring the usage of the different cores and ram
4. contorl over signal stregnth and usage, and ideally error rate detection and reporting
5. report the failures in rf susbsyestems possible, especially in error reporting management and usage of stubs 
6. repeat for the IMU susbsystem 
7. implement gps over uart in its entirity
8. report any possible hardware bugs, how they can be handled and how they are currentyly being handled 
9. observe and predict core usage trends and any cases where the task list may cuase too much delay until the pid loop sare processed, and add an solutions to mitigate this risk to reports
10. add a new set of firmwares for a well made base station using the same hardware connected to a pc and create a easyto use forn t end ui for its real time control
11. add support for using a contorller to use a s a dorne controller i nthe ui and add flight insturmenation panels ot the ui as well ofr the abs estation
12. add a method to create waypoints, perhaps inheritnig code from ardupilot, allowibng the drone to use gps to steer itself to a alocation. 
13. add examples for all functionalities, along wsith some real-world usage examples.

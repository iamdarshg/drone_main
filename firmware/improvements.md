# Suggestions for Improvement

1. Consider using CAN or Ethernet for higher-reliability inter-MCU comms.
2. Add hardware redundancy for power and RF paths.
3. Use CRC32 in addition to Hamming for longer packets.
4. Implement OTA firmware update support.
5. Add SD card logging for post-flight analysis.
6. Use a more advanced RTOS (e.g., Zephyr) for better multicore support.
7. Add hardware-based watchdogs for all critical paths.
8. Consider sensor self-test routines at startup and in-flight.
9. Add a web-based or graphical ground station frontend.
10. Use DMA for all high-speed data paths (IMU, RF, GPS).
11. Add battery health and power monitoring.
12. Consider FOC or advanced motor control for efficiency.
13. Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
14. Use static analysis and MISRA-C compliance for safety.
15. Document all APIs and protocols thoroughly.

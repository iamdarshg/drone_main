# Hardware Implementation TODO List

- Review all IMU ODR and FIFO settings against latest datasheets; update supported values as needed.
- Validate S2-LPQTR RF hardware configuration and error handling in real-world tests.
- Confirm GPS UART baud and framing with actual GPS module.
- Test all bus monitoring and error reporting on real hardware.
- Add hardware-in-the-loop tests for all critical safety features (watchdog, self-test, error flags).
- Document any hardware-specific quirks or errata found during bring-up.
- Update firmware and documentation as hardware changes are made.

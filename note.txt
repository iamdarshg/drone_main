any task can be split into sub-tasks, 
stubs are to be entirely unused by the time the tasks are compelted. use as much time and resources as needed. 
tasks lie in compilot.txt and report anything requested to reports.txt. only add a task to done.txt if all its subtaslks are compeleted in their enirity and nothing is left be done, i.e. all stubs are removed, it is well documented and all functionality poossible is added. keep doing tasks and create observe.txt when the todo list has run out. 
tasks may take as much time as needed, and as many retrials as needed but should be made to the leevl of comp-eletion as seen iin porofessionally-held embedded codebases like ardupilot.

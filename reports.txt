## Task 8: Hardware bug reporting and handling
- Hardware bugs can include: bus contention, IMU lockup, RF desync, GPS UART framing errors, RAM overflow, and core starvation.
  - All hardware error checks (bus, IMU, RF, GPS, RAM) are now performed by the M0 core via `m0_check_all_hardware()` in `watchdog_m0.c`.
  - Error flags are set by the M0 and can be queried by the M4 for system response and mitigation.
  - Bus contention: Detected by bus_monitor on M0, triggers error flag and can reset bus.
  - IMU lockup: Detected by imu_monitor self-test on M0, triggers error and can reset IMU.
  - RF desync: Detected by rf_monitor error count on M0, triggers error and can reset RF chip.
  - GPS UART framing: Detected by gps_uart_read_line on M0, triggers error and can re-init UART.
  - RAM overflow: Detected by ram_monitor on M0, triggers error and can reset or halt system.
  - Core starvation: Detected by core_monitor on M0, can trigger warning or task rebalancing.
All error handling is modular and can be extended for new hardware bugs. All hardware error checks and monitoring are now performed by the M0 core. The M4 core queries status and responds to flags set by the M0 as needed.

## Task 9: Core usage trend prediction and PID loop delay mitigation

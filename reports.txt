# Reports

All progress, issues, and completions for tasks in copilot.txt will be reported here as requested in note.txt.

---

## Task 1: Strong PID loops (multi-variable)
- Implemented `pid.c` and `pid.h` for a strong, multi-variable PID controller.
- Created `examples/pid_example.c` to demonstrate usage with multiple sensor variables.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 4: RF signal strength, usage, and error rate monitoring
- Implemented `rf_monitor.c` and `rf_monitor.h` for tracking RF TX/RX count, error count, and signal strength.
- Added integration comments to `rf_s2lpqtr.c` for real hardware usage.
- Created `examples/rf_monitor_example.c` to demonstrate monitoring features.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 5: RF subsystem failure/error reporting
- Implemented `rf_error_report.c` and `rf_error_report.h` for reporting RF failures and error status.
- Created `examples/rf_error_report_example.c` to demonstrate error reporting.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 6: IMU subsystem error/status monitoring
- Implemented `imu_monitor.c` and `imu_monitor.h` for IMU self-test and error flagging.
- Created `examples/imu_monitor_example.c` to demonstrate IMU monitoring.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 7: GPS over UART
- Implemented `gps_uart.c` and updated `gps_uart.h` for full GPS NMEA over UART.
- Created `examples/gps_uart_example.c` to demonstrate GPS reading and parsing.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 8: Hardware bug reporting and handling
- Hardware bugs can include: bus contention, IMU lockup, RF desync, GPS UART framing errors, RAM overflow, and core starvation.
  - All hardware error checks (bus, IMU, RF, GPS, RAM) are now performed by the M0 core via `m0_check_all_hardware()` in `watchdog_m0.c`.
  - Error flags are set by the M0 and can be queried by the M4 for system response and mitigation.
  - Bus contention: Detected by bus_monitor on M0, triggers error flag and can reset bus.
  - IMU lockup: Detected by imu_monitor self-test on M0, triggers error and can reset IMU.
  - RF desync: Detected by rf_monitor error count on M0, triggers error and can reset RF chip.
  - GPS UART framing: Detected by gps_uart_read_line on M0, triggers error and can re-init UART.
  - RAM overflow: Detected by ram_monitor on M0, triggers error and can reset or halt system.
  - Core starvation: Detected by core_monitor on M0, can trigger warning or task rebalancing.
All error handling is modular and can be extended for new hardware bugs. All hardware error checks and monitoring are now performed by the M0 core. The M4 core queries status and responds to flags set by the M0 as needed.

## Task 9: Core usage trend prediction and PID loop delay mitigation
- Core usage and RAM are monitored in real time (core_monitor, ram_monitor).
- If core usage is high or PID loop is delayed:
  - System can log a warning and raise a flag.
  - Solutions: Lower non-critical task priority, increase PID task priority, or offload work to M0 core.
  - Optionally, use a watchdog to reset or alert if PID loop is not serviced in time.
- These mitigations are documented and can be tuned in firmware.
- PID loop delay and task priority monitoring now handled by M0 core.

## Task 10: Base station firmware and UI
- Created `base_station/` with modular firmware, UI, and example directories.
- Implemented base station firmware main loop for RF/USB bridging.
- Added a PyQt5 starter UI for real-time telemetry and control.
- Documented structure and features in README files.

## Task 13: Real-world usage and IMU examples
- Added `examples/imu_lsm303c_example.c` for LSM303C IMU usage and self-test.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 14: Hardware support checks for all data rates, FIFO settings, etc.
- Implemented hardware support check functions for LSM303C ODR/FIFO in `imu_lsm303c_support.c` and header.
- Created `examples/imu_lsm303c_support_example.c` and `imu_lsm303c_all_features_example.c` to demonstrate and verify hardware support.
- All IMU configuration functions now check against datasheet-supported values. Hardware support checks are now performed by the M0 core where possible.

## Task 15: Hardware implementation changes via hardware TODO list
- Created and maintain `hardware_todo.txt` to track all pending and required hardware implementation and validation tasks.
- All hardware-specific changes, validation, and bring-up steps are documented and tracked in this file.

## Task 16: Task priority management and PID offload
- Solutions for lowering non-critical task priority, increasing PID task priority, and offloading work to the M0 core are implemented and documented in firmware and `reports.txt`.
- M0 core now handles PID loop delay and task priority monitoring, with flags and APIs for the M4 core to respond as needed. All monitoring and error detection for task priority and PID loop timing is performed by the M0 core.

## Task 17: Move all watchdogs for state detection, task priority, and PID loop delay to M0 core
- Extended `watchdog_m0.c/h` to monitor PID loop timing and task priorities.
- M0 can now flag PID loop delays and manage task priority flags for the system.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

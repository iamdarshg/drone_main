# Reports

All progress, issues, and completions for tasks in copilot.txt will be reported here as requested in note.txt.

---

## Task 1: Strong PID loops (multi-variable)
- Implemented `pid.c` and `pid.h` for a strong, multi-variable PID controller.
- Created `examples/pid_example.c` to demonstrate usage with multiple sensor variables.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 4: RF signal strength, usage, and error rate monitoring
- Implemented `rf_monitor.c` and `rf_monitor.h` for tracking RF TX/RX count, error count, and signal strength.
- Added integration comments to `rf_s2lpqtr.c` for real hardware usage.
- Created `examples/rf_monitor_example.c` to demonstrate monitoring features.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 5: RF subsystem failure/error reporting
- Implemented `rf_error_report.c` and `rf_error_report.h` for reporting RF failures and error status.
- Created `examples/rf_error_report_example.c` to demonstrate error reporting.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 6: IMU subsystem error/status monitoring
- Implemented `imu_monitor.c` and `imu_monitor.h` for IMU self-test and error flagging.
- Created `examples/imu_monitor_example.c` to demonstrate IMU monitoring.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 7: GPS over UART
- Implemented `gps_uart.c` and updated `gps_uart.h` for full GPS NMEA over UART.
- Created `examples/gps_uart_example.c` to demonstrate GPS reading and parsing.
- All code is modular, well-documented, and stub-free.

## Task 8: Hardware bug reporting and handling
- Hardware bugs can include: bus contention, IMU lockup, RF desync, GPS UART framing errors, RAM overflow, and core starvation.
- Current handling:
  - Bus contention: Detected by bus_monitor, triggers error flag and can reset bus.
  - IMU lockup: Detected by imu_monitor self-test, triggers error and can reset IMU.
  - RF desync: Detected by rf_monitor error count, triggers error and can reset RF chip.
  - GPS UART framing: Detected by gps_uart_read_line returning <0, triggers error and can re-init UART.
  - RAM overflow: Detected by ram_monitor, triggers error and can reset or halt system.
  - Core starvation: Detected by core_monitor, can trigger warning or task rebalancing.
- All error handling is modular and can be extended for new hardware bugs.

## Task 9: Core usage trend prediction and PID loop delay mitigation
- Core usage and RAM are monitored in real time (core_monitor, ram_monitor).
- If core usage is high or PID loop is delayed:
  - System can log a warning and raise a flag.
  - Solutions: Lower non-critical task priority, increase PID task priority, or offload work to M0 core.
  - Optionally, use a watchdog to reset or alert if PID loop is not serviced in time.
- These mitigations are documented and can be tuned in firmware.
